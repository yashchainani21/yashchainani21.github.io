# Research

I am broadly interested in harnessing machine learning to address pressing questions in both computational biology and chemistry with a focus on building reliable ML models from unreliable data. Some of my current research interests include:

- Building foundation models for sequence data in biology and/ or small-molecules in chemistry.
- Leveraging foundation models to guide autonomous scientific discovery.
- Retrosynthetic planning and reasoning with reinforcement learning.
- Generally quantifying uncertainty/ reliability in AI4Science

Below are my academic publications and research contributions:
