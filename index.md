## About Me

Hi! I am a final-year PhD candidate working at the intersection of machine learning, computational biology, and cheminformatics. 

My research focuses on making ML models more trustworthy and robust in the face of unreliable data - using synthetic data, data augmentation, contrastive learning and reinforcement learning. Unlike natural language, biology and chemistry are fields where high-quality data can be scarce and often noisy, which makes developing methods that perform well in low-data and/ or imperfect-data regimes especially critical. Most recently, I’ve become particularly interested in leveraging these techniques to build large reasoning models for biology and chemistry.

Prior to starting my PhD, I completed my undergraduate degree in chemical engineering at UC Berkeley. While at Berkeley, I took on additional courses in data science and machine learning, which eventually catalyzed my jump to working on problems in computational biology and artificial intelligence in graduate school.
