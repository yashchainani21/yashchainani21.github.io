## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate studying computational biology and cheminformatics at the department of chemical engineering at [Northwestern University](https://northwestern.edu). I am also a part of the new pathway development group at the [Joint BioEnergy Institute](https://jbei.org) (JBEI) within Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). My thesis focuses on the development of retrobiosynthesis software & machine learning models to help synthetic biologists discover novel metabolic pathways to key small-molecules for biomanufacturing. 

Prior to starting my PhD, I completed my undergraduate degree in chemical engineering at UC Berkeley. While at Berkeley, I took on additional courses in data science and machine learning, which eventually catalyzed my jump to working on problems in computational biology and artificial intelligence in graduate school.
