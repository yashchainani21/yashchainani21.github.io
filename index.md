## About Me

Hi! I am a final-year PhD candidate working at the intersection of machine learning, computational biology, and cheminformatics.

My research focuses on making ML models more trustworthy and robust in the face of unreliable data - using synthetic data, data augmentation, contrastive learning and reinforcement learning. Unlike natural language, biology and chemistry are fields where high-quality data can be scarce and often noisy, which makes developing methods that perform well in low-data and/ or imperfect-data regimes especially critical. Most recently, Iâ€™ve become particularly interested in leveraging these techniques to build large reasoning models for biology and chemistry. You can find all of my existing publications and select talks on my [google scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dyNc88kAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

Prior to starting my PhD, I completed my BS in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at [UC Berkeley's College of Chemistry](https://chemistry.berkeley.edu). While at Berkeley, I took several courses in data science and machine learning, which catalyzed my jump to working on problems in AI x Bio when I started graduate school at the department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at [Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/chemical-biological/). At Northwestern, I am fortunate to be co-advised by two brilliant scientists, [Linda Broadbelt](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/broadbelt-linda.html) and [Keith Tyo](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/tyo-keith.html). I am also a member of the [Center for Synthetic Biology](https://syntheticbiology.northwestern.edu) at Northwestern and of the new pathway development group at the [Joint BioEnergy Institute](jbei.org) at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://www.lbl.gov).
