## About Me

I am a PhD candidate studying computational biology & cheminformatics at the department of chemical engineering at Northwestern University. I am also a part of the new pathway development group at the Joint BioEnergy Institute within Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. My thesis focuses on the development of automated retrobiosynthesis software & machine learning models to help synthetic biologists discover novel metabolic pathways to key small-molecules for biomanufacturing. 

Prior to starting my PhD, I completed my undergraduate degree in chemical engineering at UC Berkeley. While at Berkeley, I took on additional courses in data science and machine learning, which eventually catalyzed my jump to computational biology in graduate school.
